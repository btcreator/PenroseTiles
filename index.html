                <h2>What is that?</h2>
                <p>
                    Penrose tiling is a never repeating infinity pattern which got his name
                    after Roger Penrose (mathematician and physicist) in the 1970s. For that
                    aperiodic pattern you need just 2 different certain shapes, and follow some
                    placement rules. For more information about what exactly a Penrose pattern is,
                    please visit Wikipedia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think the most known tiles are romboids, but for that project I used an other
                    variants, the Kite and Dart shapes. This generator generates an accurate random
                    pattern from these. You have the possibility to adjust some properties of the
                    tiling before generate, so feel free to play aroud.
                </p>

                <h2>Why I do that?</h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted for an other Project a dinamically changing Penrose pattern background,
                    but I nowhere could found a code or a random generator for that (in best case an
                    API). I do learn Programming and I belive, the best way to further develop
                    skills is just coding line by line and solve the problems which comes in your
                    way, so I decided make it on my own. The real goal for that project is to make
                    an API too for the pattern generator, so that everyone can easy implement it in
                    his work when will a dinamically changing design.
                </p>

                <h2>It's made for us!</h2>
                <p>
                    You can use it for generating an impressive backgrounds, printouts and for your
                    other design works. Feel free to use, copy, paste or modify the generated image
                    and the whole code in your projects. (scroll down for the link)
                </p>

                <h2>As next?</h2>
                <p>
                    I would put some new features with time to the Project, like gradient coloring
                    (see this background), random coloring, live settings thumbnail view. <br />
                    As next I will learn node JS, that I could build an API for that
                    Project...(coming up next ;) ). <br />
                    When you have an issue, idea or find some Bugs, I would be glad to hear from
                    you.

                    Hello! <br />
                    My name is Peter Duricek and I love solving problems. In programming I could
                    find the best desire, because when there is a solution for a problem, you have
                    all the tools to find it. It's just up to me whether I can solve it or not.
                    <br />
                    I feel no limits..
