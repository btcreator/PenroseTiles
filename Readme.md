Random Penrose Pattern Generator
=========================================

This generator generates a PPT (Perfect Pattern Tileing) from a randomly placed tile.

### Why is this different than other penrose pattern generators

By this project I don't use the inflation / deflation method, but instead just place tiles one by one next to each other.

I hope, you will find it useful to your works.

Best Regards
Peter
